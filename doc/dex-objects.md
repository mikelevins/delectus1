# Dex Objects

**Dex Objects** are the objects that a user interacts with to build a
Dex document. They are the conceptual building blocks that Dex users
work with.

The Dex objects are:

- Deck: A Dex document, organized as a deck of **cards**. A Dex data
  file is also referred to as a Deck.

- Card: An individual page of a Dex document.

- Background: The backdrop of a card. Several cards can share the same
  background.

- Widget: A Picture, Button, Field, or List. Widgets can appear
  in cards or backgrounds.

- Script: A simple program attached to another object. Every type of
  object except Script itself can have a Script attached to it.


Dex objects are stored in Deck files.
