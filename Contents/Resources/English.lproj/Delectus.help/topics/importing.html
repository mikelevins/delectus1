          <p>Delectus can import data in CSV format. CSV (or
          "comma-separated values") is a common format for exchanging
          data among database and spreadsheet applications. Most
          database and spreadsheet programs can export data as
          CSV.</p>

          <p>There's no special "import" command in Delectus. If you
          want to import CSV data, simply find the CSV file and open
          it in Delectus. Delectus automatically converts the CSV data
          to its own format.</p>

          <p>You should make sure that the CSV file has the labels of
          its columns in the first line, and that no two columns have
          the same label.</p> 

          <p>Programs that export their data as CSV usually provide a
          way to say whether to put the column labels in the first
          line; just make sure you use that option when exporting your
          data to CSV.</p>

          <p>Most programs that can export CSV have the same
          requirement that each column must have its own label, so in
          most cases you won't have to do anything special to ensure
          that your data can be read by Delectus.</p>
