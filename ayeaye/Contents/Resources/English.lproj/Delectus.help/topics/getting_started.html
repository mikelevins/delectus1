          <p>Delectus creates, edits, and saves lists. Lists of what?
          Lists of anything you choose.</p>

          <p>A Delectus list is made of rows that are divided into
          columns. You decide how many columns to make, and what
          label each one has. You decide how many rows to add. You
          decide what text to put in each column of each row.</p>

          <p>Delectus was originally designed to help a little old
          lady keep track of all the movies in her very large
          collection, but you can use it to keep lists of anything
          you wish.</p>

		<h1>The Main Window</h1>

          <p>The first time you launch Delectus, it creates an empty
          document window. The window looks something like
          this:</p>

          <p><img src='../images/main_window.png' width='467' height='435'/></p>

          <p>The main parts of the window are labeled:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>The <strong>Main List Area</strong> shows the
            items in the document. Each row contains one item.</p></li>
            <li><p>The <strong>Add and Delete Rows</strong> buttons
            enable you to add rows in which you can enter
            information, or to delete rows when they are no longer useful.</p></li>
            <li><p>The <strong>Add and Delete Columns</strong> buttons
            offer the same ability for columns, enabling you to add or
            remove them as needed.</p></li>
            <li><p>The <strong>Trash Button</strong> shows you when
            items have been deleted, and enable you to make the
            deleted items visible, so that you can undelete them if
            you wish.</p></li>
            <li><p>In the <strong>Search Box</strong>, you can type
            text to search for matching items.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Here's what a list document looks like when it's filled
          with items:</p>

          <p><img src='../images/main_window2.png'/></p>

          <p>Each item is on its own row. The columns ("Number",
          "Title", "Star", and "Date Created" in the example) are
          names that you create, using the <strong>Add Col</strong>
          button.</p>

          <h2>How to Create a Document</h2>

          <p>How do you get from an empty document, like the one at
          the top of this page, to a filled document, like the one
          below it?</p>

          <p>Easy:</p>
          
          <ol>
            <li><p>Start by launching Delectus, or, if it's already
            running, pull down the "File" menu and choose
            "New". Delectus creates a new empty document.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add some columns by clicking the <strong>Add
            Col</strong> button at the top right. Delectus asks you
            for a label for each new column. It won't let you use a
            label if there's already a column in the document that
            uses it; each column has to have its own label.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add a row by clicking the <strong>Add Row</strong>
            button at the top left. Delectus adds a new empty row. You
            can type the information you want into each column of the
            new row by clicking in each column of the row. You don't
            have to add information to every column. In fact, you can
            leave the whole row empty if you want, but then it might
            be a little bit hard to tell that it's there.</p></li>
            <li><p>When you're done entering your information, save
            the document. Pull down the "File" menu and choose
            "Save", or "Save As", and choose a place to save your new
            list document.</p></li>
          </ol>

          <p>That's it! The next time you open that document, your
          items will be in it. Make sure you remember where you saved
          it!</p>
