		<h1>Adding Columns</h1>
		<div class="main">
          <p>A column is a vertical section of your list document
          with a label at the top. The label can be anything you like
          (as long as there isn't another column with the same
          label!), and you can add as many columns as you like to any
          Delectus document. You can also remove columns at any time.</p>

          <p>To add a column, click the <strong>Add Col</strong>
          button at the top right corner of the Delectus window:</p>

          <p><img src='../images/add_col.png'/></p>

          <p>Click the <strong>Add Col</strong> button (it looks like
          a big black "plus" sign), and Delectus asks you for a label
          for the new column. It then creates the new column with the
          label you gave it.</p>

		<h1>Removing Columns</h1>

          <p>You can remove a column using the <strong>Delete
          Col</strong> button. Usually, the <strong>Delete
          Col</strong> button is grayed out, as it is in the
          illustration above. It becomes active only when you select a
          column by clicking its label at the top. When
          the <strong>Delete Col</strong> button is active, clicking
          it removes the selected column.</p>

          <p>If you try it now, you might notice that as soon as you
          delete the column, the <strong>Trash Button</strong> at the
          bottom left corner of the window changes its
          appearance. Instead of an empty trash basket, it shows a
          full one. That's to let you know that the document has
          deleted items. If you click the <strong>Trash
          Button</strong>, it shows all the deleted items in red, and
          it displays the message, "Deleted items are red". Click it
          again, and the deleted items, and the message,
          disappear.</p>

          <h2>Emptying the Trash</h2>

          <p>You might be wondering, "why are those items still in the
          document, if I deleted them?" Delectus doesn't completely
          destroy them when you delete them. It keeps them around in
          the Trash, in case you delete something by mistake and want
          to get it back. If you really want to make sure that
          deleted items are gone forever, pull down the "File" menu
          and choose "Empty Trash." Delectus permanently removes all
          the items that are in the trash. Make sure you really want
          to remove them, because once Delectus empties the Trash, it
          has no way to get those items back.</p>
          
		<h1>Renaming Columns</h1>

        <p>What if you decide that you want to change one of the
        column labels? It's easy to do: click the label at the top of
        the column to select it, then pull down the "Edit" menu and
        choose "Rename Column". Delectus asks you for a new
        label. After it accepts the new label, it changes the column
        to use it in place of the old one. Remember: a document cannot
        have two columns with the same label.</p>
