		<h1>Adding Rows</h1>
		<div class="main">
          <p>A row is a horizontal division of a document that
          contains all the information for one list item. It contains
          one text box for each column, and you can enter any text
          you wish into each box. You can add as many rows as you
          like into a Delectus document, and each one can have any
          text you like. The only restriction is that each row has
          the same columns as every other row.</p>

          <p>To add a row, click the <strong>Add Row</strong>
          button at the top left corner of the Delectus window:</p>

          <p><img src='../images/add_row.png'/></p>

          <p>Click the <strong>Add Row</strong> button (it looks like
          a big black "plus" sign), and Delectus immediately adds a
          new empty row. The new row doesn't look like much at first;
          you have to add some text to at least one of its columns
          before there is much of anything to notice about it. When
          creating it, Delectus highlights the new row, to let you
          know it's there.</p>
          
		<h1>Removing Rows</h1>

          <p>You can remove a row using the <strong>Delete
          Row</strong> button. Often, the <strong>Delete
          Row</strong> button is grayed out, as it is in the
          illustration above. It becomes active only when you select a
          row by clicking one of the pieces of text in the row. When
          the <strong>Delete Row</strong> button is active, clicking
          it removes the selected row.</p>

          <p>If you try it now, you might notice that as soon as you
          delete the row, the <strong>Trash Button</strong> at the
          bottom left corner of the window changes its
          appearance. Instead of an empty trash basket, it shows a
          full one. That's to let you know that the document has
          deleted items. If you click the <strong>Trash
          Button</strong>, it shows all the deleted items in red, and
          it displays the message, "Deleted items are red". Click it
          again, and the deleted items, and the message,
          disappear.</p>

          <h2>Emptying the Trash</h2>

          <p>You might be wondering, "why are those items still in the
          document, if I deleted them?" Delectus doesn't completely
          destroy them when you delete them. It keeps them around in
          the Trash, in case you delete something by mistake and want
          to get it back. If you really want to make sure that
          deleted items are gone forever, pull down the "File" menu
          and choose "Empty Trash." Delectus permanently removes all
          the items that are in the trash. Make sure you really want
          to remove them, because once Delectus empties the Trash, it
          has no way to get those items back.</p>
