		<div class="main">
          
          <p>Some of your lists may get very long, and you may wonder
          how you'll ever find a particular item in the list. One way
          to find things is to use the <strong>Search
          Box</strong>. Simply type some text into the <strong>Search
          Box</strong> at the bottom right corner of the Delectus
          window, and Delectus filters out every item in the list
          that doesn't match.</p>

          <p>You don't have to do anything special besides typing; as
          you type, Delectus compares what you've typed so far to
          everything in the list, and hides every item that doesn't
          match. It also shows a count of how many items are shown,
          updating the number as items are filtered out.</p>

          <p>The search box doesn't actually remove anything from the
          document. If you want to see everything in the list again,
          simply click the little "X" button at the right end of
          the <strong>Search Box</strong>, and you'll see all the
          items in the list reappear.</p>

          <p>The <strong>Search Box</strong> matches any text that
          appears anywhere in an item, so if you type "foo", then
          items are shown that have the text "foo" in any position, in
          any column.</p>
